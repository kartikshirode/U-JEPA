    Parameter collision analysis and nuclear norm distributions for O-LoRA and N-LoRA. O-LoRA exhibits higher parameter collisions and nuclear norms, while N-LoRA effectively reduces collisions, ensuring better orthogonality and task-specific accuracy.

## 🛠️Setup

You can install the required libraries by running 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You are also required to download the t5-large model from huggingface, put it to the folder named ```initial_model```, and rename the model folder as 't5-large'.

LLaMA is also supported. You can put your llama model to the folder named ```initial_model``` and rename the model folder as 'llama'.



## 🚀Training and Evaluation

For t5-large:

You can reproduce our experiments of order 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 by simply running

order1:

```
bash scripts/order_1.sh> logs_and_outputs/order_1/logs/train_and_infer.log 2>&1 &
```

order2:

```
bash scripts/order_2.sh> logs_and_outputs/order_2/logs/train_and_infer.log 2>&1 &
```

order3:

```
bash scripts/order_3.sh> logs_and_outputs/order_3/logs/train_and_infer.log 2>&1 &
```

order4:

```
bash scripts/order_4.sh> logs_and_outputs/order_4/logs/train_and_infer.log 2>&1 &
```

order5:

```
bash scripts/order_5.sh> logs_and_outputs/order_5/logs/train_and_infer.log 2>&1 &
```

order6:

```
bash scripts/order_6.sh> logs_and_outputs/order_6/logs/train_and_infer.log 2>&1 &
```


The model you have trained will be saved in ```logs_and_outputs/order_1(2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6)/outputs```.

The result of each task will be saved in ```logs_and_outputs/order_1(2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6)/outputs/TASK_NAME/predict_results.json```.

You can also check the logs during training and infering in  ```logs_and_outputs/order_1(2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6)/logs/train_and_infer.log```

For LLaMA:

order1:

```
bash scripts_llama/order_1.sh> logs_and_outputs_llama/order_1/logs/train_and_infer.log 2>&1 &
```

order2:

```
bash scripts_llama/order_2.sh> logs_and_outputs_llama/order_2/logs/train_and_infer.log 2>&1 &
```

order3:

```
bash scripts_llama/order_3.sh> logs_and_outputs_llama/order_3/logs/train_and_infer.log 2>&1 &
```
